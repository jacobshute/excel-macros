# Excel Macros
These are VBA macros that I use in Excel
Some are simple shortcuts but others are larger functions for doing tasks like listing out the files in a directory.

## Simpler shortcuts with key maps
- Add and Remove rows - Ctrl + e/E
- Add and Remove cells- Ctrl + w/W
- Clear all - Ctrl + D
- Toggle blue highlight - Ctrl + h
- Row Size 15 - no key

## Funtions
- List Files in a Directory
    - Takes a directory name from a cell and copies its contents into the cells below
- Random Word
    - fills selected cells with random characters to represent words


## Forms
- Combine Sheets
    - opens a form to select from sheets in the current workbook.
    - combines sheets into a new merge sheet
